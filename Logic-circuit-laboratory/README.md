# Logic Circuits Lab

This folder contains all files related to the Logic Circuits Laboratory course.

## Description

The contents of this folder cover basic and advanced topics in digital logic, including:

- Logic gates  
- Combinational circuits  
- Sequential circuits  
- Simulations and circuit designs using Proteus

All circuit designs are created and tested using **Proteus**. Youâ€™ll find both schematic files and simulation results here.

## Folder Structure

- `.DSN` and `.PDSPRJ` files: Circuit designs (Proteus)
- `Images/` (optional): Screenshots of circuit outputs
- `Reports/` (optional): Any lab notes or observations

## Requirements

To open and run the circuits, install [Proteus Design Suite](https://www.labcenter.com/).

## Notes

All files are named clearly based on their function (e.g., `combinational_mux.dsn`, `sequential_counter.dsn`).  
This repository is mainly for educational use and experimentation during the Logic Lab sessions.
