# Stack Project: Parentheses Balance Checker

### Description:
This program uses a stack data structure to check whether a given expression has balanced parentheses or not. It goes through each character in the input string and uses stack operations to push and pop parentheses. If all opening parentheses are matched with closing ones correctly, the expression is considered balanced.

### Concepts Practiced:
Stack operations (push, pop) - Matching opening and closing symbols - Basic input validation
