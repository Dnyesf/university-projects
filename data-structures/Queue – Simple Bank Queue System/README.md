# Queue Project: Simple Bank Queue System
### Description:
This is a simulation of a simple bank queue using the queue data structure. Customers can be added to the queue, served in order, and the current queue status can be displayed. It demonstrates real-world FIFO (First In First Out) behavior.

### Concepts Practiced:
Queue operations (push, pop, front) -
Menu-based user interaction -
Handling real-life scenarios using data structures
