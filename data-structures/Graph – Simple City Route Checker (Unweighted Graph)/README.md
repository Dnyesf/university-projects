# Graph Project: City Route Checker
### Description:
This program builds an undirected graph of cities and roads. Users can add connections (edges), view the entire map (adjacency list), and check whether a path exists between two cities using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Concepts Practiced:
Graph representation using adjacency lists -
BFS for path finding -
Using STL containers (unordered_map, vector, queue, set) -
Real-world graph application: map and routing
